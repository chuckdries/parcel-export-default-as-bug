This is a minimal setup to demonstrate a bug @parcel/library-bundler with `export {default as name} from "file"` syntax with ESModules.

## Repro
1. look at `src/__localization__/index.js` - note it should export `en_us`
2. run `npm run build` 
3. observe `dist/__localization__.hash.js`
Expected: file contains `en_us` export
Observed: file does not export anything.

Note that this does work when you build a cjs module, but our particular requirements in our real project are to build an ESM package, and we cannot rewrite `__localization__/index.js` to work around the issue as it is generated by localization automation tools that are outside of our control.
